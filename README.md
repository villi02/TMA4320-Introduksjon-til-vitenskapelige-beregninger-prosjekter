# TMA4320 Introduction to Scientific computing - the projects
 Repo containing the projects for the course TMA4320 at NTNU, taken during spring 2024.

Welcome to the repository containing three distinct projects focusing on different domains of science and engineering. Each project is self-contained and addresses unique research questions and methodologies. These projects are from spring 2024.

NB! Notebooks are mostly written in Norwegian

## Projects

### [1. Biophysics: Simulating Polymers using Monte Carlo](Prosjekt1-BioFysikk)

**Description:**
This project involves the simulation of polymer chains to study their physical properties and behavior under various conditions. Also includes a focus on runtime and achieving computation efficiency.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of polymer simulation using Monte Carlo
- Analysis of polymer dynamics and structure
- Visualization of simulation results

**Dependencies:**
- NumPy, Matplotlib

**How to Run:**
1. Navigate to the `Prosjekt1-BioFysikk` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run simulations in the `main.ipynb` notebook.

### [2. Industrial Mathematics: Creating a Transformer from Scratch](Prosjekt2-IndustriellMatematikk)

**Description:**
This project involves the implementation of a Transformer neural network from scratch, focusing on the underlying mathematical principles and efficient computation.

**Key Features:**
- Custom implementation of the Transformer architecture
- Example datasets and pre-processing scripts
- Mathematical foundation described along the way

**Dependencies:**
- NumPy, Matplotlib

**How to Run:**
