# TMA4320 Introduction to Scientific computing - the projects

Welcome to the repository containing three distinct projects focusing on different domains of science and engineering. Each project is self-contained and addresses unique research questions and methodologies. These projects are from spring 2024.

NB! Notebooks are mostly written in Norwegian
